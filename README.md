# ASL Recognition Integrated With Drone Technology

## Introduction 
This research is part of the capstone project developed by Clara (Trang) Dang, Kajal Shukla, Davis Thomas, and Josh Park for the degree of Master of Science in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago. The development spanned over 6 months and involved three missions, which are facial recognition, ASL recognition, and drone integration. However, in this repository, I focus on the section that I was the primary contributor, which is the ASL recognition section. We developed a model that can intricately extract features of hand movements and generate a classification of corresponding letters in the American Fingerspelled Alphabet
